# entity

Entity is a simple, idiomatic library for using an entity-component-system in Go. This lirbary draws inspiration from [EngoEngine/ecs](https://github.com/EngoEngine/ecs) but with a more streamlined implementation.

## Introduction to Entity Component Systems

An Entity-Component-System (abbreviated ECS) is a common development pattern in game development that takes advantage of common features of games, such as repeated behaviors that are exhibited in multiple 'entities.' Within an ECS, an entity is typically no more than a mere identifier.
